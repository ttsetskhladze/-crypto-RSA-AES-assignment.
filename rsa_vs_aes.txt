RSA vs AES - Performance and Use-Case Differences

Performance:
- RSA: Extremely slow for large data. With 4096-bit key and PKCS1 padding, max plaintext ~446 bytes. Encryption takes ~50-200ms.
- AES-256: Hardware-accelerated (AES-NI), encrypts gigabytes per second. No practical size limit.

Use Cases:
RSA (Asymmetric):
• Key exchange during TLS handshake
• Digital signatures and certificates
• Encrypting small data (e.g. symmetric keys only)
• No shared secret required initially

AES-256 (Symmetric):
• Bulk data encryption (files, disks, VPNs)
• Streaming encryption (HTTPS data, SSH)
• Full-disk encryption (BitLocker, LUKS)
• Requires secure key exchange (usually via RSA/ECDHE)

Real-World: Hybrid encryption
→ Generate random AES key → Encrypt data with AES → Encrypt AES key with RSA
Used in: PGP, S/MIME, TLS <1.3 (RSA key transport), secure messaging apps.
